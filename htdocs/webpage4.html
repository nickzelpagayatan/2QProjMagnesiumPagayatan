        <article class="webpage-actual-content">
            <h6>I assume that we can collectively agree that we are all exhausted. In today's world, where we try to be present 24/7, our tasks, responsibilities, and commitments tax our emotional and mental capacity.
                <br><br>
                Fortunately, sometimes, we have it lighter than the people around us: our families, friends, and the people we love. The moment we notice their struggles, we can lend a hand and an ear and maybe make the weights in their backs a little lighter.
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">A good companion reassures.</span>
                <br><br>
                Whatever happens, we must attempt to stay compassionate and understanding to those who struggle. Reassuring people that you will always be on their side is a simple thing yet will bring a huge difference. This makes people feel more secure that someone cares for them and is willing to actively listen (keyword: actively) and help them get through their current struggles. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">A good companion asks.</span>
                <br><br>
                Asking a person about their mental health problems is an excellent avenue for you to be aware of what they are going through. This will enable you to share information, support, care, and guidance accordingly. However, we must know first if they are safe and comfortable talking about their mental health concerns as these are sensitive; better if they will be the ones to open up and start a conversation with you. 
                <br><br>
                Once they are ready to start a conversation, pay attention and listen attentively. Show that you are expressing compassion and sympathy. As much as possible, avoid sugar-coated and judgemental responses. Be straightforward while not being offensive.
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">A good companion gets permission.</span>
                <br><br>
                Now that you have talked, reacting is a natural thing to do: trying to help alleviate the situation by giving advice and help. However, we must always ask the person if they want to get an act of assistance or receive pieces of advice, as these can make them uncomfortable. You are not to therapize. You can help, but do not presume that you know what's best for them.
                <br><br>
                When in doubt, ask. Ask if they are okay with you doing something. Sometimes, trying to help may make things worse. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">A good companion shares.</span>
                <br><br>
                Offering them a different perspective can help them go through tough times. You can also share your past experiences and how you overcame them. This may bring them a sense of hope and strength. However, do not invalidate what the person is going through. This is not about you.
                <br><br>
                You can also share resources, such as help hotlines, self-help content, and, if possible, a contact to a mental health specialist. Encourage them to seek professional help, if needed, and get treated as soon as possible.
                <br><br><br>
                We do not know what each one of us is going through. Being with someone during tough times is one way to show that we genuinely love and care for them. After all, we all hope to feel better; why not feel better together?
