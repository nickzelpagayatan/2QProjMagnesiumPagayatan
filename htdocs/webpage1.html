            <h6>People usually associate being healthy with being free of diseases. However, this is untrue as there are various components of health that we need to consider to assess the well-being of an individual.
                <br><br>
                According to the <a class="content-a-underline" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-strengthening-our-response"> World Health Organization</a> (WHO), "health" refers to the overall state of one's physical, mental, and social well-being. It is a necessity for daily survival and emphasizes "social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities."
                <br><br>
                Asking ourselves these questions once in a while is critical to self-awareness. Knowing your current state helps you identify if you have been taking care of yourself, if you are still functioning well, if you are healthy, happy, and living the way you want to live.
                <br><br>
                The two types of health are physical and mental health. Physical health is the state of one's body, while mental health encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">Mental Health</span>
                <br>
                Mental health is an integral aspect of our well-being, for it tells us how we think, feel, act, and react; without it, there is no health. Multiple factors determine our mental wellness: family history, past experiences, and biological factors, including brain chemistry and genetics. 
                <br><br>
                We can assess our mental state through three (3) aspects: 1 - we are taking good care of ourselves, 2 - we are fulfilling our everyday responsibilities, and 3 - we healthily interact with other people. We can also say that we are taking good care of ourselves if we can balance the different aspects of life: our physical, social, spiritual, and financial life. 
                <br><br>
                However, failure to meet these conditions may cause poor mental well-being or mental health illnesses. A person can experience poor mental health but may not have a mental health illness. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">Mental Health Illnesses</span>
                <br>
                <a class="content-a-underline" href="https://doh.gov.ph/sites/default/files/health_advisory/IRR%20of%20RA%2011036.pdf"> According to Republic Act 11036</a>, the Mental Health Law of the Philippines, one has a mental health illness if a licensed psychiatrist clinically diagnoses a disorder of one's cognition, emotional regulation, and behavior. These mental health disorders may be acquired from genetics, especially when first-degree relative/s (parents and grandparents) also have said disorders. 
                <br><br>
                Moreover, we can also develop these illnesses through our lifestyle, habits, outlook, and past experiences. The disease may manifest as early as the developing stages after childbirth, or in some cases, when something triggers, which depends on the illness. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">Mental Health in the Philippines</span>
                <br>
                Mental health is one of the concerns in the Philippines, especially in this time of health crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Fortunately, the Department of Health (DOH) continues to implement a <a class="content-a-underline" href="https://doh.gov.ph/national-mental-health-program">mental Health program</a>, which aims to "prevent mental, psychosocial, and neurologic disorders, substance abuse and other forms of addiction, and reduce burden of disease by improving access to quality care and recovery in order to attain the highest possible level of health to participate fully in society."
                <br><br>
                The DOH partners with national government agencies and non-government organizations in facilitating the program components. These include the promotion of wellness of daily living and educating Filipinos on mental and neurologic disorders and forms of addiction, including substance abuse. More information about DOH's mental health program can be found on its <a class="content-a-underline" href="https://doh.gov.ph/">website</a>.
                <br><br><br>
                Mental health is just as important as our physical health; indeed, it should also be given attention and care.
