        <h5>SUBTOPIC 2</h5>
        <h1>COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS<span class="title-italic-span"> of Filipinos About Mental Health<br></span></h1>
        
        <div id="content-banner">
            <img src="../images/subtopics/mentalHealthMisconceptions.png">
            <a class="image-section-source" href="https://heraldofilipino.com/mental-health-not-gawa-gawa-lang/">HERALDO FILIPINO</a>
        </div>

        <article class="webpage-actual-content">
            <h6>From the first subtopic, we talked about mental health as an integral part of our well-being, and it is as important as our physical wellness. However, people react differently to the physical and mental health of others.
                <br><br>
                Let me ask you a question: what do you think of when you hear that someone has cancer? On the other hand, what comes to your mind when you hear someone has a mental health illness? Unfortunately, people would have different descriptions for each: a person with cancer is sick, brave, and a warrior for battling the disease, but a person with mental health illness is weak, unstable, emotional, or worse, an attention seeker.
                <br><br>
                How did these varying perceptions emerge, more specifically, in the Philippines? 
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">Culture and Religion</span>
                <br>
                Looking back to the pre-colonial and colonial Philippines, supernatural forces and religious factors were believed to have caused mental illnesses <a class="content-a-underline" href="http://www.sop.org.tw/sop_journal/Upload_files/31_2/001.pdf">(Samaniego, 2017)</a>. These factors include offending a particular deity or being cast with wicked incantations (witchcraft); as a result, mentally-ill Filipinos were brought to churches or albularyos (folk healers) to get treated. Because of this, the mentally ill were often feared, discriminated against, and excluded.
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">Mental Health Illnesses as a Medical Concern</span>
                <br>
                However, mental illnesses were finally considered medical illnesses only during the American occupation. This resulted in advocacies for a more humane approach in treating mental health; in fact, the first hospital for the mentally ill was built in 1904.
                <br><br>
                Transitioning to the 1940s, mental health systems and specialty societies had been established. These include the Philippine Mental Health Association in 1949, which endorsed a national educational movement called "National Mental Health Week."
                <br><br>
                The treatment of mental health illnesses also progressed during the 70s. Psychiatrists leaned to a more biological technique, from the use of tranquilizers, sedatives, and antidepressants.
                <br><br>
                Despite these advancements, the stigma on mental health remained even until now.
                <br><br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">Stigma on Mental Health</span>
                <br>
                According to the <a class="content-a-underline" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/stigma">Cambridge Dictionary</a>, stigma is a "strong feeling of disapproval that most people in a society have about something, especially when this is unfair." And from studying history, we see how stigma on mental health emerged and is still alive in today's society because of the lack of knowledge about what it is and its causes.
                <br><br>
                Here are some misconceptions of Filipinos about mental health that contributes to the prevalence of stigma today:
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">Mental Health Illnesses are Not Real</span>
                <br>
                Despite the Department of Health (DOH) and the  <a class="content-a-underline" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-strengthening-our-response">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> recognizing that mental health illnesses are just like any other physical diseases, Filipinos still believe that people just make up their mental illness. Mental health illnesses are diseases of the brain; thus, people who have these are sick. You don't just make up a disease.
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">Mentally-Ill People are Weak</span>
                <br>
                People with mental illnesses are not weak in character; their mental issues are the ones challenging them. These people battle their disease every single day: they are brave. What we should think instead is having a mental health concern is the same as being physically unwell, which requires professional medical attention. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">Mentally-Ill People are Crazy and Unstable</span>
                <br>
                People with illnesses struggle—the same way goes for people with mental health illnesses. However, their struggles are just different from those with physical diseases. Mental illnesses affect the way they act and feel, and they oftentimes do not mean the things they say or do. Instead, they need to be given understanding, patience, and compassion. After all, nobody chooses to get sick.
                <br><br><br>
                These stigmas bring negative effects not just to the person with mental illness but to people who care for them. However, we can always do something about them by being a mental health ally.
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">Educate yourself</span>
                <br>
                The root cause of stigma is the lack of knowledge on mental health, illnesses, and what they are and their causes. However, learning about these things can help us understand mental health more and help mentally-ill people in the best way possible and based on factual information about these diseases.
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">Choose your words</span>
                <br>
                Never hurt and invalidate the feelings of a person struggling with their mental health. Moreover, avoid words that perpetuate mental health stigma. For example, saying you are OC about cleaning, but you are just neat, or saying you are depressed, but you are just sad. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">Listen</span>
                <br>
                Be open-minded on the perspective of people with mental illness: the symptoms they experience, how it affects their lives, how they were stigmatized. Choose to create a healthy and safe environment for conversations.
                <br><br>
                <span class="content-subtitle">Speak</span>
                <br>
                Correct people who stigmatize mental health in a respectful and non-condescending way. We all came to a time when we were uneducated about mental health and mental illnesses. The goal here is to educate, not shame others for having wrong ideas about mental health.
                <br><br><br>
                Let's create a future wherein people can talk comfortably about their mental health concerns. These people need attention and care. And we all can take part: either in perpetuating the stigma or eradicating it. However, we must (keyword: must) choose to be inclusive and understanding. Let's battle mental health illnesses—together.
